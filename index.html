          <p>
            This guide is designed to introduce you to Canada’s Algorithmic
            Impact Assessment—or AIA.
          </p>
          <p>
            The AIA takes the form of an open-source questionnaire platform,
            which is available via the Government of Canada on
            <a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/aia-eia-js">GitHub</a>. The
            goal of this guide is to give communities, scholars, governments,
            and you—dear reader—the context and tools needed to build on this
            platform and help develop more inclusive approaches to AI
            governance discourse.
          </p>
          <h4>Using this guide</h4>
          <p>
            Canada's AIA is a messy assemblage of people, ideas, technical
            objects, and bureaucratic processes. Instead of condensing that
            complexity into a single narrative, this guide is organized into three
            categories. Each category offers us a different way to think about the
            AIA, which in turn offers us different ways to think about creative
            interventions and engagements.

          <h4>What's an AIA?</h4>
          <p>
            Algorithmic Impact Assessment, or AIA, refers to a broad group of
            processes for defining, evaluating, and mitigating risks or harms
            posed by algorithmic systems—including AI systems. The concept
            borrows from "impact assessments" in other domains, including
            privacy impact assessments and environmental impact assessments.

            Let’s set aside the content of AIA questionnaire and the policy
            environment the AIA is meant to be used in. We can think of
            Canada’s AIA as an open-source policy platform.

            for the AIA contains the source code for the AIA itself, as well
            as a few useful developer tools. This repository is the actual
            development environment for the live AIA, which that means that
            anyone can participate in the development of the platform.
          </p>
          <h4 id="frameworks">Languages and Frameworks</h4>
          <p>
            The main AIA platform is built using the Vue JavaScript framework.
            Versions have been built using
            <a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/aia-eia.git">Python and Django</a>,
            <a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/aia-eia-net.git">C# and .NET</a>, and pure
            <a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/aia-eia-js.git">JavaScript</a>. When the project was in development,
            early versions even hosted
            the AIA as a
            <a
              href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CcQJ-YlT_2nqTlrrEsXy0_Rs6gLqCdgMK8tL9kMZX9E/edit#gid=0">spreadsheet</a>!
          </p>
          <p>
            The questionnaire portion of the AIA is built using a modified
            version of <a href="https://surveyjs.io">SurveyJS</a>—a
            JavaScript library for building surveys and questionnaires. One
            particularly useful feature of SurveyJS is that it provides a
            <a href="https://surveyjs.io/create-survey/">web-based visual editor</a>
            for building and modifying questionnaires.
          </p>
          <p>
            The repo also includes a python
            <a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/aia-eia-js/blob/master/survey-json-to-csv.py">script for converting
              AIA surveys from JSON files to CSV</a>. This can be a useful way to visualize the entire questionnaire,
            as well as the weights assigned to specific questions.

          <p class="note">
            Note: the script provided in the repo is setup for use on Windows
            and uses backslashes for file paths. To run the script on a Mac or
            another UNIX-based system, replace the backslashes with slashes,
            or download this

          <p>
            If the AIA is a platform, what are it’s features?
            <br>
            We can think about this by walking through the platform itself.
          </p>

          <h4 id="context">Context and Landing Pages</h4>

          <p>
            When you open the
            <a href="https://open.canada.ca/aia-eia-js/?lang=en">live version</a>
            of the AIA, the first thing you’ll notice is the landing page.
            This page provides context for the AIA tool, including how it is
            supposed to be completed, who is expected to completed it, and
            what to do after it’s completed. This page is the bridge between
            the AIA platform and its regulatory context. It expresses a vision
            of how the AIA is supposed to be used, and how it’s expected to
            function as a regulatory tool.
          </p>

          <p>
            After clicking the "Start your assessment" button, you’ll be
            brought to the beginning of the questionnaire itself. The first
            page is, again, descriptive. It provides a summarized description
            of the tool itself, as well as instructions for actually using the
            tool.
          </p>

          <h4 id="sections">Sections</h4>

          <p>
            The platform is divided into two major sections, and several
            subsections. We can refer to the major sections as the "impact
            section" and the "mitigation section," because questions in each
            section contribute to different scores. Each of these sections has
            subsections, which focus on particular aspects of the system. The
            dropdown menu at the top of the page allows you to quickly jump
            between these subsections.
          </p>

          <h4 id="scoring">Scoring</h4>

          <p>
            You’ve probably noticed an (initially) green bar at the bottom of
            your screen. This bar displays your score as you progress through
            the AIA. There are 3 scores displayed: a raw impact score, a
            mitigation score, and "current score". The "current score" is raw
            impact score minus 15% <em>if</em> the system scores at least 80%
            of the maximum mitigation score.
          </p>

          <p>
            The colour of the scoring bar corresponds to the impact level
            displayed on the left of bar. The bar turns green for impact level
            1, blue for level 2, yellow for level 3, and red for level 4.
          </p>

          <p>
            In this case, impact levels correspond to requirements set out in
            the Canadian Treasury Board Secretariat’s
            <a href="https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32592">Directive on Automated

            to only select one option from a group. In the Government of
            Canada’s AIA, they’re mostly used for "yes/no" questions or other

          <h5>Exporting responses</h5>

          <p>
            Once you begin the questionnaire, an additional "Save" button
            appears. This allows you to download a JSON file with your
            responses up to that point.

          <p>
            Canada’s AIA primarily exists in relation to the Treasury Board
            Secretariat’s <em>Directive on Automated Decision-Making</em>. The
            Directive guides most Canadian federal government agencies and
            departments' use of ADM (automated decision-making) systems.
            The Directive doesn't apply to "national security
            systems" or to the work of most agents of parliament, like
            Elections Canada and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner.
          </p>
          <p>
            Directives are a specific kind of policy in the Treasury Board’s
            <a href="https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=13616#cha3">policy instrument hierarchy</a>.
            Directives are meant to explain <em>how</em> a policy objective
            should be met. They're also mandatory policy within the
            Canadian government, but they
            <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3722192">don't create any actionable
              rights</a>

          <h4>What’s the Treasury Board?</h4>
          <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasury_Board_of_Canada">Treasury Board of Canada
              Secretariat</a> (TBS for short) is a central branch of the Canadian federal government. TBS’s role is
            largely the management and administration of the Canadian public service itself. For example, TBS oversees
            the federal access to information system. TBS is also home to Canada’s Office of the Chief Information
            Officer, who developed and oversee the Directive on Automated Decision-Making and the AIA.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="grid">
        <div class="column1">
          <h4 id="definition">Defining "ADM"</h4>

          <p>The Directive <a href="https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32592#appA">defines</a> "Automated
            Decision System" as:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>Includes any technology that either assists or replaces the judgement of human decision-makers. These
              systems draw from fields like statistics, linguistics, and computer science, and use techniques such as
              rules-based systems, regression, predictive analytics, machine learning, deep learning, and neural nets.
            </p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>AIAs are often discussed in the context of artificial intelligence (AI). But as the TBS’s definition
            demonstrates, AIAs often focus on how the algorithm is used, rather than how it works. The TBS definition
            includes systems that use "AI" methods, but it’s mostly concerned with whether or not the system is used to
            replace human judgment.</p>

      <div class="grid">
        <div class="column1">
          <h4 id="consultations">Coming Into Force and Consultations</h4>

          <p>The Directive was first formally introduced in 2019. It came into force a year later, in April 2020, and
            only applies to systems implemented or substantially changed after that date. But both the Directive and
            Canada’s AIA can <a
              href="https://medium.com/code-for-canada/responsible-ai-in-the-government-of-canada-a-sneak-peek-973727477bdf">trace
              their origins</a> to 2016, with the drafting of a government white paper on "Responsible Artificial
            Intelligence in the Government of Canada."A more recent version of that white paper is <a
              href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Sn-qBZUXEUG4dVk909eSg5qvfbpNlRhzIefWPtBwbxY/edit">still
              available on Google Docs</a>.</p>

          <p>Early parts of this policy project were conducted in an exceptionally open process. Early drafts of both
            the white paper and the AIA were hosted on Google Docs, and they were shared for comment via Twitter and the
            Government’s GCCollab. The project team also led consultations with internal departments and external
            experts. In principle, the open drafts were open to public comment, but in practice the process mostly
            engaged experts. No public consultations were held.</p>

          <h4 id="admin-law">Principles of Administrative Law</h4>

          <p>The Directive is primarily concerned with ensuring that automated decision-making systems are implemented
            in a way that is "compatible with core principles of administrative law," including "transparency,
            accountability, legality, and procedural fairness."</p>

          <p>Understanding the Directive’s grounding in administrative law is fundamental to understanding the
            Directive. These principles are reflected in the design of the AIA platform, and in the AIA’s questionnaire.
            They also inform the design of the procedures and remedies established by the Directive, like its focus on
            having a human-in-the-loop (accountability/procedural fairness) and on disclosure of automated decisions
            (transparency).</p>

          <p>It bears noting that (as Teresa Scassa <a
              href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3722192">demonstrates</a>) just because the goal
            is to translate administrative law principles to an automated decision-making context doesn’t mean that
            these principles can be straightforwardly translated.</p>

          <p>The Directive (and by extension the AIA) undergo mandatory periodic reviews. The <a

                  <li>Peer review</li>
                  <li>Notice</li>
                  <li>Human-in-the-loop for decisions</li>
                  <li>Explanation requirement</li>
                  <li>Training</li>
                  <li>Contingency planning</li>
                  <li>Approval for the system to operate</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <br>
              <p>Within each category, the specific requirements scale proportionally with the system’s impact
                level. For example, level 1 and 2 systems don’t require a human-in-the-loop at all. Whereas level
                3 and 4 system require "specific human intervention points" throughout the decision-making
                process, and the final decision for systems at these impact levels must be made by a human.</p>
              <br>
              <p class="note">Note: It isn’t possible to "fail" the algorithmic impact assessment, and the Directive
                itself doesn’t disallow systems of any kind. The requirements for level 4 systems are quite onerous,
                however, and they are designed to strongly disincentivize very high risk systems.</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Implement requirements</li>
              </ol>
              <p>The final step of the process is, of course, to actually implement the Directive’s requirements. This
                includes specific requirements based on the system’s impact level, as well as several baseline
                requirements for all systems.</p>
              <br>
              <p>This step changes the most depending on what stage in the development process the system is at (more on
                that in a second). As we discuss in the <a href="#function">Function section</a>, one of the ways that
                the AIA can function is by encouraging best practices and de-risking a system. If a team doesn’t want to
                comply with a requirement, they can try to modify the system to lower its impact level instead.</p>

          <h4 id="scope">Scope of the Directive?</h4>

          <p>Before applying any of the Directive’s processes and requirements, public servants need to determine if
            the system in question is in scope of the Directive to begin with.</p>
          <div class="inline-list">
            <p>Broadly speaking, the Directive applies to "any system, tool, or statistical models used to recommend or
              make an administrative decision about a client."(<a
                href="https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32592#cha5"> § 5.2</a>) But there are additional
              limitations to the Directive’s scope:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The Directive currently only applies to external-facing systems. ADM systems that are only used
                internally by the government, for the government, are currently exempt.</li>
              <li>The Directive doesn’t apply to "national security systems.&quot;</li>
              <li>The Directive doesn’t apply to systems that aren’t in production, like systems operating in test
                environments.</li>
              <li>The Directive only applies to systems developed or procured after the Directive came into force on
                April 1, 2020.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <br>
          <h4 id="design">Design Stage</h4>

          <p>The first application of the Directive’s process begins in the design stage of a project. Once the scope
            and general design of the system are established, an initial AIA needs to be completed before the system
            goes into production.</p>

          <p>The design-stage AIA is not published or made public. Instead, these initial AIAs do two things:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>They guide the implementation of risk mitigation processes, based on responses to the mitigation
              section of the AIA.</li>
            <li>Based on the impact level, they guide what requirements need to be put in place. Some requirements—like
              peer review—need to take place before the system goes live. While others—like having a
              human-in-the-loop—may need to be planned for and built into the system itself.</li>
          </ol>

          <h4 id="implementation">Implementation Stage</h4>

          <p>The Directive’s process is applied for a second time after the system is built, but before it goes live.
            Assuming that no major changes have been made to the system, it is unlikely that any new requirements will
            be introduced during the implementation stage. Instead, the AIA is completed again to validate the
            design-stage AIA and to reflect any changes to the system during the development process.</p>

          <p>The final AIA, completed at the implementation stage, then must be published on <a
              href="https://search.open.canada.ca/opendata/?collection=aia&amp;page=1&amp;sort=date_modified+desc">Canada’s
              Open Government Portal</a>.</p>

          <h4 id="post-implementation">Post-Implementation Stage</h4>

          <p>Many of the Directive’s requirements create ongoing obligations. For example, the Directive requires that
            processes be developed for ongoing monitoring of a system’s compliance and decision outcomes.</p>

          <p>The AIA may also need to be updated after the system goes live. Any time that the system’s functionality
            substantially changes, or the scope of the automated decision changes, the AIA needs to be updated.</p>

          <h3 id="questionnaire">AIA Questionnaire</h3>
          <p>The Directive on Automated Decision-Making provides a framework and process for regulating ADMs in the
            government of Canada. But as we now know, that process relies heavily on "impact levels" established by
            the AIA. So what is the AIA actually assessing, and how are the Directive’s impact levels determined?</p>
          <h4>Questionnaire Overview</h4>
          <p>We can break down the AIA questionnaire itself into two sections—risk and mitigation. Each section has
            several sub-sections, and each sub-section contains one or more questions to which the applicant must
            provide a response.</p>
          <p>Based on the responses provided by the applicant, the system calculates two scores: a "raw impact score"
            based on the risk section, and a "mitigation score" based on the mitigation section. The raw impact score
            draws on questions about how the system works and what decision is going to be automated, while the
            mitigation score measures what practices have been put in place to mitigate those risks.</p>

          <h4>Read the full description</h4>
          <p>This section is intended to be a digestible overview of the AIA’s questions and scoring system. If you’re
            interested in learning more, TBS have put together an excellent detailed description on the <a

          <h4 id="main-scores">Impact and Mitigation Scores</h4>
          <p>The system calculates the raw impact and mitigation scores based on the value assigned to each question in
            their section. The "riskier" an answer is, the higher its score. Ultimately, the score assigned to any given
            question is arbitrary and determined by the Treasury Board.</p>
          <p>Reminder: Questions associated with <a href="#Scoring">"free-text" inputs</a> can’t contribute to the AIA’s
            scoring.</p>
          <p>The risk section has there are a total of 48 questions, and a total possible maximum raw impact score of
            107. Within the risk section, the "Data" "Impact" sub-sections contain the most questions and contribute the
            most to the raw impact score. Accordingly, they contribute the most to the overall score calculated for the
            risk section.</p>
          <p>The mitigation section has a total of 33 questions, and a maximum section score of 45. There are only two
            mitigation sub-sections: Consultations" and "De-risking and mitigation measures.’’ 31 of the 33 mitigation
            questions are in the later section.</p>
          <h4 id="current-score">Calculating Current Score</h4>
          <p>The raw impact score and mitigation score are used to calculate an overall score. This score is referred to
            as the "current score" in the AIA. The final impact level is based on how close the final "current score" is
            to the maximum possible score. A higher current score means a higher impact level, which in turn means more
            stringent requirements (per the Directive).</p>
          <div class="inline-list">
            <p>The current score doesn’t just combine the raw impact score and mitigation score. Instead, the current
              score is <a

              <li>"If the mitigation score is 80% or more than the maximum attainable mitigation score, 15% is deducted

          <p>One way we can approach Canada’s AIA is by thinking about it’s “functions.” What are the mechanisms by
            which the AIA affects change? How do different mechanisms affect the design, audience, and use of the AIA?
            How does the AIA contribute to or help achieve a given goal?</p>
          <h3 class="why">Why It Matters</h3>
          <p>In this context, we can think about “functions” like a hypothesis; a theory of causation, and way of
            thinking about both what we’re trying to achieve and (crucially) how we expect to achieve it. If our goal is
            to make sure that AI systems are trustworthy, and we’ve decided to use an AIA, how do we expect the AIA to
            help achieve that goal?</p>
          <p>The answer is less straightforward than it might seem. There are at least 5 different ways that Canada’s
            AIA can function within a given context. And as we’ll see in a moment, even a relatively straightforward
            example—like an AIA in the context of the Directive on Automated Decision-Making—can function in several
            different ways at the same time.</p>
          <div class="inline-list">
            <p>Having a clear understanding of <em>how</em> we expect the AIA to work is important for two reasons:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>It gives us a way to measure the system’s success. (A key performance indicator, if you will.)</li>
              <li>It gives us a framework for suggesting, designing, and evaluating changes and new features.</li>
            </ol>
          </div>
          <h3 id="official">Official Functions</h3>
          <p>There are at least 3 ways that we can think about Canada’s AIA “functioning” in the context the Directive
            on Automated Decision-Making.</p>
          <h4>Defining the Problem Statement</h4>
          <p>Before considering how the AIA functions to achieve a particular goal, we need to define what that goal is.
          </p>
          <p><a href="https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32592#cha4">Section 4</a> of Directive on
            Automated Decision-Making provides quite a clear objective for the policy. It states:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>The objective of this Directive is to ensure that Automated Decision Systems are deployed in a manner
              that reduces risks to Canadians and federal institutions, and leads to more efficient, accurate,
              consistent, and interpretable decisions made pursuant to Canadian law.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Put more concisely, we can say that the stated goal of the Directive (and by extension the government’s use
            of the AIA) is to ensure safe, fair, and responsible use of ADMs. How, then, does the AIA help achieve this
            goal?</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="grid">
        <div class="column1">
          <h4>Nudge Function</h4>
          <p>Going sequentially, the first way that the AIA can function is by acting as a “nudge” and encouraging best
            practices (whatever those may be in a given context). In the Government of Canada’s implementation of the
            AIA, this largely occurs during the <a href="#design">design stage</a>. The design stage is where the most
            substantial changes to the system can be made, and it’s also the first time in a project’s lifecycle that
            the AIA is used.</p>
          <div class="inline-list">
            <p>This function occurs in two ways:</p>
            <div class="intermittent-list intermittent-list-counter">
              <ol>
                <li style="padding-top: 0em;">Encouraging consultation</li>
              </ol>
              <p>The Government of Canada’s AIA questionnaire is intentionally designed to require consultation outside
                of the group developing or implementing a particular ADM system. In some cases this is done overtly,
                like the “consultations” sub-section which asks whether respondents “will be engaging with” either
                internal or external stakeholders.</p>
              <p>In other cases, the scope of knowledge required to respond to a question acts as a more subtle nudge.
                The “about the data” sub-section of the questionnaire, for example, asks extremely specific technical
                questions which effectively require discussions between policy makers and developers.</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Rewarding Best Practices</li>
              </ol>
              <p>The mitigation score in particular is designed to reward certain practices without making them
                mandatory. Unlike the impact score, where every scored question adds to or detracts from the total, the
                mitigation score only helps the final score if the system achieves 80% or more of the maximum possible
                mitigation score. This creates a strong incentive to adopt not just one, but almost all of the practices
                endorsed in the mitigation sub-section.</p>
              <p>We could also likely consider the nudge effects of gamifying the AIA via the scoring system in general,
                but that discussion is beyond the scope of this guide…</p>

              <li>In both cases, it is the <em>process</em> of filling out the AIA where the AIA performs its function.
                The intended audience in this function are the respondents themselves.</li>
              <li>In both cases, the AIA functions by nudging respondents towards certain actions, rather than
                explicitly mandating them. Even when the nudges are extremely overt, they’re still voluntary.</li>
            </ol>

          <h4>Enforcement Function</h4>

          <p>The second way that the AIA can function is by acting as a measurement tool, which informs formal and
            enforceable requirements. In the Government of Canada’s implementation of the AIA platform, this is the
            primary purpose of the <a href="#main-scores">scoring system</a> and the corresponding impact levels in the
            Directive.</p>
          <p>In this case, the AIA almost acts like a contract. The respondent describes the system, and then the AIA
            score determines which set of requirements (see: <a href="#gen-procedure">impact levels</a>) apply. After
            the AIA is completed, it still functions as a reference for what standards should be enforced for a given
            system. The AIA serves as an agreement between the respondent and an oversight body as to what standards the
            system should be held to.</p>
          <p>This function occurs after an AIA is completed, and it necessarily involves some kind of oversight or
            regulatory body. Within the Directive on Automated Decision-Making, enforcement and non-compliance are
            managed by the Treasury Board. Potential consequences and enforcement actions are determined by the Treasury
            Board’s <a href="https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=17151#appC">Framework for the Management
              of Compliance</a>.</p>

            <p>The third way that the AIA can function is as an object that serves as a focal point for discussion and
              critique of
              the underlying ADM-system being assessed. This function is enabled by two features of the Government of
              Canada’s AIA
              system:</p>
            <div class="intermittent-list intermittent-list-counter">
              <ol>
                <li>The fact that the system produces a PDF as an output</li>
              </ol>
              <p>By generating a PDF, the completed AIA becomes a “thing” in the world. We can imagine a version of
                Canada’s AIA
                which simply outputs a score rather than a document of the completed questionnaire. The “thing-ness” of
                completed AIAs allows them to have effects after their completion.</p>
              <ol>
                <li>The fact that completed AIAs are published and public</li>
              </ol>
              <p>A “thing” isn’t very useful without someone to use it. The Directive requires implementation-stage AIAs
                to be <a
                  href="https://search.open.canada.ca/opendata/?collection=aia&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;sort=date_modified+desc">published</a>
                on Canada’s <a href="https://open.canada.ca/">Open Government Portal</a>. And it’s the publication of
                completed AIAs is what realizes the potential of the AIA’s output.</p>

          <p>The mechanisms which contribute to the enforcement and accountability functions also draw attention to how
            different functions can conflict with each other.
            <br>
            <br>
            Free-text fields in the AIA questionnaire are an important tool for accountability, but they don’t
            contribute to the AIA’s score. If new questions and areas of inquiry are only added to the AIA as free-text
            fields, they can’t contribute to the AIA’s enforcement function.

          <h3>Potential Functions</h3>
          <p>In the context of the Directive on Automated Decision-Making, the AIA functions in these three ways:
            nudges, enforcement, and accountability. But there are other ways that we can imagine the AIA functioning.
          </p>
          <p>For example, <a href="https://datasociety.net">Data &amp; Society’s</a> excellent <a
              href="https://datasociety.net/library/assembling-accountability-algorithmic-impact-assessment-for-the-public-interest/">work
              on AIAs</a> draws attention to distinction between “impacts” and “harms.” Impacts are what an AIA
            measures, but harms are what is felt on the ground. Ideally, the relationship between impact and harm in an
            AIA should be as close as possible, but that isn’t always the case. How, then, might we re-imagine or
            repurpose Canada’s AIA to have a harm-reduction function?</p>
          <p>We can also imagine a consultative function for Canada’s AIA. Could the AIA be used to engage publics at
            the design stage? Or perhaps we could flip the script and allow publics to design questionnaires and
            scoring sheets for policy makers to use?</p>
